## Background

It’s a beautiful spring day, and it’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

I was asked to design tables to hold data in the CSVs (data modeling), import the CSVs into a SQL (Postgres) database(data engineering), and answer questions (d ata analysis).
